Replit AI, I want you to fix, polish, and finalize the DEZHYNE website design with the following detailed improvements.
Keep the overall layout as is (since it’s clean), but apply these visual corrections, animations, and enhancements exactly as described below.

🧭 NAVBAR & LOGO

Logo fix:

Remove the white background from the logo — only show the “D” shape and text (“DEZHYNE”) clearly.

Increase the logo size by 40–50% so it’s visible and premium at the top-left.

Maintain proper alignment vertically centered with the navbar items.

Navbar alignment:

Keep all menu items center-aligned horizontally.

“Let’s Talk” button remains at far right (slightly larger, gradient hover).

Navbar hover animation:

Add a smooth underline slide-in effect for active and hovered links.

🏠 HOME PAGE FIXES

Hero Section

Maintain the same text and layout (it looks good).

Add slight scroll motion or fade-in on hero text.

Use a soft animated gradient background (pastel light tones — creamy beige, soft blue, lilac, or peach blend).

Keep the CTA “Get Started” button bold with a light glow hover.

Brands Section (Trusted by Leading Brands)

Replace plain text brand names with actual logo icons of known or placeholder brands (e.g., Adobe, Google, Spotify, Shopify, Airbnb, Figma).

Keep logos grayscale, colorize slightly on hover.

Maintain spacing consistency.

Duplicate Section Issue

The “Let’s Build Something Great Together” section (above the footer) is a duplicate of the footer CTA — remove this top duplicate section entirely.

Keep only the final footer section that begins with “Let’s start something great together.”

Animations & Transitions

Apply smoother entrance animations (fade-up, slight parallax).

Add gentle scroll-based animations for each home section.

⚙️ SERVICES PAGE FIXES

General

Keep the structure (Brand, Tech, Media) — it’s well-organized.

Maintain alternating image + text blocks.

Add light pastel backgrounds (not pure white) for sections to create visual separation.

Tabs (Brand Solutions, Tech Solutions, Media Solutions)

Make these tabs fade/blend out on scroll down — they shouldn’t stay fixed while scrolling.

Add a subtle shadow while they’re visible, then fade out smoothly as the user scrolls into the content.

Animations

Add subtle content reveal animations (fade-right or fade-up).

Add hover scale for images.

💼 PORTFOLIO PAGE

Keep structure same but improve visuals:

Replace plain images with portfolio mockups (or project images).

Add hover overlay: title + category fade in with blur effect.

Add subtle transition when moving between categories.

Smooth loading animation when the page opens.

📰 BLOGS PAGE & PRIVACY POLICY FIX

Blogs Page (Currently 404):

Create a new Blogs page using a modern 3-column grid layout.

Each blog card should have:

Featured image

Blog title

Short snippet text

“Read More” link or button

Add 3–6 dummy posts initially for layout consistency.

Use vibrant blog thumbnails similar to Schbang style (colorful gradient headers).

Privacy Policy Page (Fix 404):

Create a clean, functional privacy policy page with proper text content.

Keep it minimalist, white background with black text.

Link it in the footer (small text link on the bottom-right).

📞 CONTACT PAGE

Form Redesign

Redesign to match the minimalist Zerocac style:

Underline-only inputs (no border boxes).

Fields: Name, Email, Phone, Message.

Add placeholders, not labels above.

Button: “Send Message” — black text, light hover gradient.

Layout

Left: Contact form

Right: Contact info (Address, Phone, Email, Hours) in light gray box or soft pastel background.

Add subtle entrance animations on load.

General Theme

Maintain minimalist white/pastel blend background.

Add tiny icons beside each info item.

🌈 ANIMATIONS + COLOR PALETTE

Add cooler animations overall — scroll fades, section slides, hover glows.

Keep motion light, smooth, and professional (no fast pop-ins).

Replace pure white backgrounds with light pastel blends (e.g., off-white, soft blue, beige, lavender).

Each page should feel alive but elegant — creative agency vibe.

🧩 GLOBAL CLEANUP

Make sure no sections repeat unnecessarily (especially CTAs).

Ensure all pages (Home, Services, Portfolio, Blogs, Contact, Privacy Policy) load without 404 errors.

Optimize all assets for responsiveness.

Double-check navbar, footer, and logo are consistent sitewide.

🪄 Final Visual Mood

The entire DEZHYNE site should feel premium, minimalist, creative, and futuristic — similar to Zerocac + WeThinkElastic + Schbang blended together, but using a rich pastel-light palette instead of plain white.
Every section should flow smoothly with natural animations and clean typography.
