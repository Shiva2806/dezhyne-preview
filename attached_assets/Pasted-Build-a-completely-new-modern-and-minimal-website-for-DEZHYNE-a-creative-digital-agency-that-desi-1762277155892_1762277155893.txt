Build a completely new, modern, and minimal website for DEZHYNE, a creative digital agency that designs and develops premium online experiences.

The website should feel fresh, high-end, and tech-driven, inspired by Zerocac, WeThinkElastic, and Schbang — combining clean whitespace with bold typography, smooth animations, and a storytelling flow.

This is a complete redesign from scratch, not a theme reskin. Rebuild every page structure, section hierarchy, and animation.

Goal: To position DEZHYNE as a next-generation creative and tech studio offering branding, development, and marketing solutions to businesses.

🎨 Design System

Theme: White background with soft pastel gradients (light gray, beige, or cream tones).

Typography: Bold, modern sans-serif (Poppins, Inter, or Satoshi).

Logo: Use provided Dezhyne logo (slightly larger, black on white).

Colors: Black text, pastel highlights (blue, peach, lilac).

Layout: Wide spacing, clean grid, strong visual hierarchy.

Animations: Smooth GSAP / Framer-style fades, scroll-triggered reveals, hover transitions, subtle parallax.

Imagery: Unique, non-repeated images and mockups — clean, professional, and light-toned.
